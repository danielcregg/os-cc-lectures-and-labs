# Building Your First WordPress Website

## Introduction

WordPress is a popular content management system that helps you create and manage websites without needing advanced technical knowledge. This guide will walk you through creating your first WordPress website, explaining each step in detail.

## Getting Started

Before we begin, you'll need:
- A web hosting account with WordPress support
- A domain name
- Access to your WordPress admin dashboard

## Understanding Your WordPress Dashboard

When you first log into WordPress, you'll see the dashboard - think of this as your website's control center. Let's understand what each part does:

    A --> E[Appearance: Design controls]
    A --> F[Plugins: Extra features]
    A --> G[Settings: Site configuration]
```

## 1. Creating Your First Pages

Every website needs content. Let's start by creating some basic pages:

1. Find the "Pages" menu on the left sidebar
2. Click "Add New"
3. You'll see the Block Editor, which works like a modern document editor

### Understanding Blocks
Think of blocks as building blocks for your page - like Lego pieces. Each piece has a specific purpose:
- Paragraph blocks for text
- Image blocks for pictures
- Heading blocks for titles
- Button blocks for clickable buttons

To add a block:
1. Click the (+) button in the editor
2. Choose your desired block type
3. Start adding content

### Important Page Elements

Every good page should have:
- A clear heading (use the Heading block)
- Well-organized content (use Paragraph blocks)
- Visual elements (use Image blocks)
- A call to action (use Button blocks)

## 2. Working with Media

Modern websites use lots of images and videos. Here's how to manage them:

### Adding Images
1. Click "Media" in the dashboard
2. Select "Add New"
3. Either drag files or click "Select Files"

### Image Best Practices
- Use descriptive file names (good: "red-winter-coat.jpg", bad: "IMG12345.jpg")
- Fill in the "Alt Text" field to describe your image
- Compress images before uploading to keep your site fast

## 3. Choosing and Customizing Your Theme

Your theme controls how your website looks. Here's how to choose and customize one:

```
